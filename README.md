# DeFi Stake Yield

A full stack DeFi application using [brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie), [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).

Users can stake their tokens in the contract and receive a daily ERC-20 reward based on a fixed reward factor.

# Purpose

This repository contains an implementation of a smart contract that rewards stakers with a custom ERC-20 token. This code was created as a learning experience. Any improvements and advices are more than welcome.

After finishing the initial implementation, I plan on improving the functionality and finding security vulnerabilities in this contract. Every improvement, as well as attacking scripts, will be available in this repository.

# Audit

This code has not been audited and is for learning purposes only, **DO NOT DEPLOY INTO MAINNET**.
